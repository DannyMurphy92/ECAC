<h1>City & Guilds 2079 (F Gas) Qalifications</h1>
<p>
    ECAC offers the full range of City & Guilds 2079 F Gas training and certification. We are the main provider of these qualifications in the Irish market and have been offering City & Guilds qualifications for over 10 years
    There are four categories in F Gas, from category 4 which allows candidates to leak test systems through to category 1 which qualifies technicians to undertake leak checking, recovery, installation, service and maintenance of equipment on any quantity of HFC refrigerant.

    At ECAC we offer all levels of City & Guilds certification and in addition we also offer our Intensive F Gas course. This course is aimed at technicians dealing with refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment on a regular basis but due to the nature of their work, do not have exposure to all of the elements necessary to complete the City & Guilds 2079 F gas assessment.
    The training is a blend of theory, practical and sample assessments over four days, followed by the F Gas assessment on day five.
