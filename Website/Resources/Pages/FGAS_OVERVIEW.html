<h1>City & Guilds 2079 (F-Gas) Qalifications</h1>
<p>
    ECAC offers the full range of City & Guilds 2079 F Gas training and certification. We are the main provider of
    these qualifications in the Irish market, and have been offering City & Guilds qualifications for over 10 years.
    There are four categories in F Gas, from category 4, which allows candidates to leak test systems, to category 1,
    which qualifies technicians to undertake leak checking, recovery, installation, service and maintenance of 
    equipment on any quantity of HFC refrigerant.
</p>
<p>
    At ECAC, we offer all levels of City & Guilds certification. In addition, we also offer our Intensive F-Gas course.
    This course is aimed at technicians dealing with refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment on a regular basis,
    but due to the nature of their work, do not have exposure to all of the elements necessary to complete the City &
    Guilds 2079 F-gas assessment. The training is a blend of theory, practical and sample assessments over four days,
    followed by the F-Gas assessment on day five.

<h2>F-Gas Regulations</h2>
<p>
    The Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations (EC 842/2006) came into effect on the 4th July 2007. The objective of the Regulations is to contain, prevent and thereby reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.
    The Regulation covers amongst others, the use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump applications,

    <strong>There is a legal obligation to reduce leaks and YOU are a key part of this</strong>
    <p>
        Under the European Fluorinated Gas (F Gas) Regulations, we have to take measures to reduce leakage.
        These include leak testing systems once a year if the charge is between 5 Tons CO2 equivalent and
        50 Tons CO2 equivalent and twice a year for systems with more than 500 Tons CO2 equivalent which
        must be fitted with a leak detection system.
    </p>

    <strong>What is the CO2 equivalent for the refrigerant in my system?</strong>
    <p>
        Different refrigerants have different CO2 equivalents, therefore we at ECAC have developed a simple to 
        use equivalency calculation tool. Please contact us for a free copy.

    <strong>Who is legally responsible for fixing and preventing leaks?</strong>
    <p>
        According to the F Gas Regulations, the person having control of the equipment containing the refrigerant
        i.e. 'the operator', typically a company, carries this legal responsibility. The Regulation defines the
        operator as follows:
        <br/>
        <i>
            "Operator means the natural or legal person exercising actual power
            over the technical functioning of the equipment and systems covered by this regulation".
        </i>
