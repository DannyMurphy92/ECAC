    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Every refrigeration or air-conditioning system is different. Here at ECAC we understand that an off the shelf course will not suit everybody’s requirements and therefore we will design and deliver training to suit your unique requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We will visit your site to discuss your requirements and examine your refrigeration or Air-conditioning equipment. We will produce a first draft training outline which will be issued to you for approval. When the content has been agreed we will produce all the course materials specifically designed to suit your requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes it is difficult to arrange training due to shift patterns. At ECAC will work around your staff availability, be that during the day, in the evening or at weekends.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;ECAC has a reputation for innovation and responsiveness to the requirements of Industry and the employees of Industry. We are aware that the days of a ‘job for life’ are a thing of the past and whether it be through choice or circumstances many people will change their job or employer many times over their lifetime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have developed a range of services designed to meet the requirements of our clients who are dealing with a career change or are in the process of helping their employees to prepare for a change of employer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Career Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our career guidance expert, Dr. Brian Staines, has over 30 years’ experience in career guidance and employability. Brian works with both groups and individuals in order to identify future career opportunities and options based on both the individuals past experience and qualifications and their ambitions for the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Typically, Dr. Staines works with groups from companies currently dealing with redundancies to help their employees identify and prepare for opportunities in the future. The typical career guidance seminar will commence with a group session where the relevant staff members will participate in an employability workshop both to identify current skills and future ones that they would wish to develop. On completion of this seminar, Dr. Staines will work with individuals to discuss and advise on the specifics of their situation and drawing up a positive action plan for future activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curriculum Vitae Writing Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In conjunction with our Language and Communication specialist,, Mr Robert Howe MA, and Dr Staines, each participant will be given the opportunity to develop a curriculum vitae to current international standards. The clients will be helped to develop a C.V. which emphasises their skills and experience, as well as their employability. Rob will concentrate on the use of language and syntax, while Brian will concentrate on developing the specific information to be used in the C.V.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;International CV’s 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As part of our translation services, we can also provide you with a C.V. in German. However, unlike a direct translation service, we will develop your C.V. specifically for the American, German or Middle Eastern jobs market.

The purpose of this qualification is to certify that successful candidates are competent to carry out leak checking, recovery, installation, service and maintenance of stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat-pump equipment that contains refrigerants which are classified as either fluorinated (F) gases or ozone depleting substances (ODS) regardless of the quantity of refrigerant.	
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This level is generally required by technicians and engineers working on commercial refrigeration and heat pump systems. The course and assessment assume that the candidate has a high level of prior knowledge and experience on refrigeration and heat pump systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The assessment consists of an online assessment which will assess both the technical and Legislative knowledge of the candidate and a practical assessment covering brazing, strength testing, leak checking, charging, commissioning and recovering refrigerant and oil.
