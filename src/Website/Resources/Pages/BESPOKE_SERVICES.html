<h1>Tailored Course Design and Needs Analysis</h1>
<p>
    Every refrigeration or air-conditioning system is different. Here at ECAC, we understand that an “off the shelf” 
    course will not suit everybody’s requirements.  Therefore, we will design and deliver training to suit your unique requirements. 
</p>

<p>
    We will visit your site to discuss your requirements and examine your refrigeration or air-conditioning equipment.
    We will produce a first draft training outline, which will be issued to you for approval. When the content has been 
    agreed to, we will produce all the course materials specifically designed to suit your requirements.

    Sometimes it is difficult to arrange training due to shift patterns. ECAC will work around your staff availability, 
    be that during the day, in the evening or even at weekends.
