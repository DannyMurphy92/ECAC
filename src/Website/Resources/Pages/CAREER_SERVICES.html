<h1>Career Services</h1>
<p>
    ECAC has a reputation for innovation and responsiveness to the requirements of industry and the employees of industry.
    We are aware that the days of a ‘job for life’ are a thing of the past. Whether it be through choice or circumstances, 
    many people will change their job or employer many times over their lifetime. 
</p>
<p>
    We have developed a range of services designed to meet the requirements of our clients who are dealing with a career
    change or are in the process of helping their employees to prepare for a change of employer.

<h2>Career Guidance</h2>
<p>
    Our career guidance expert, Dr. Brian Staines, has over 30 years’ experience in career guidance and employability.
    Dr. Staines works with both groups and individuals in order to identify future career opportunities and options 
    based on both the individuals past experience and qualifications and their ambitions for the future.

</p>
<p>
    Typically, Dr. Staines works with groups from companies currently dealing with redundancies to help their
    employees identify and prepare for opportunities in the future. The typical career guidance seminar will
    commence with a group session where the relevant staff members will participate in an employability workshop,
    both to identify current skills, then identify potential skills that they would wish to develop. On completion
    of this seminar, Dr. Staines will work with individuals to discuss and advise on the specifics of their situation, 
    then draw up a positive action plan for future activities.

<h2>Curriculum Vitae Writing Service</h2>
<p>
    In conjunction with our language and communication specialist, Robert Howe (M.Ed), and Dr. Staines, each participant
    will be given the opportunity to develop a curriculum vitae to current international standards. The clients will
    be helped to develop a C.V. which emphasises their skills and experience, as well as their employability. Rob will
    concentrate on the use of language and syntax, while Dr. Staines will concentrate on developing the specific 
    information, e.g., skills, to be used in the C.V.

    International CV’s

<p>
    As part of our translation services, we can also provide you with a C.V. in German. However, unlike a direct 
    translation service, we can develop your C.V. specifically for the American, German or Middle Eastern jobs market.
